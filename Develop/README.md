  ## Description
  The challenge for this week involves a readme generator used to generate a high quality readme based on the user input. The “Inquirer” module for node is used to invoke specific question that the user must answer. Based on those answers, a readme will be generated. The user must provide the title of their project, a description of their project, the instructions required to install the project, the usage information, the contribution guidelines, the test instructions, the open source license, the user’s Github username, and the user’s email address.
